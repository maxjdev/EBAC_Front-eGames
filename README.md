## Description

Together with the tutor, I developed an e-commerce dedicated to selling games, using React, Redux and TypeScript technologies. Components have been carefully structured for efficient organization. The application dynamically consumes data from an API through RTK-Query, keeping the information always up to date.
Styling was implemented with styled-components, while responsiveness is guaranteed with HTML and CSS. I adopted ESLint and Prettier to keep the code consistent and clean. Explore this project that incorporates modern technologies to offer an intuitive and engaging online shopping experience in the gaming universe.
